# BETH Stack with Bulma

An opinionated hypermedia-driven web framework that prioritizes developer experience while still having amazing performance.

Based on https://github.com/wezzcoetzee/beth-stack

This stack consists of Bun, Elysia, TypeScript, JSX templates, HTMX and Bulma CSS

## Resources

- You can find the Medium article [here](https://medium.com/@wezzcoetzee/the-beth-stack-c5887a606ed3)

- The static site is based on the Bulma Tropico template: [restylianos/bulma-tropico-template: Bulma tropico template üçç](https://github.com/restylianos/bulma-tropico-template)

### Commands

Run the server

```
bun run start
```

Kill the server

```
lsof -t -i :3000 | xargs kill
```

### TODO
- Add Customize Bulma with Sass https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/with-sass/
- add one script to build Bulma, one to build and watch for changes

### Potential Issues

- Route Conflict: The /:page? catch-all route might conflict with other specific routes if they're defined after it. Currently it's placed before the .listen(3000) call, which is correct.

- Error Handling: The error response is basic. You might want to enhance it with more detailed error information or a custom 404 page.

- Performance: Reading files synchronously with  readFileSync could impact performance under high load. Consider caching frequently accessed pages or using async file reading.

- Security: There's no path sanitization to prevent directory traversal attacks. Consider validating the page parameter to ensure it doesn't contain characters like ../.

- Overall, the implementation extends the original codebase to serve static content while maintaining all the original functionality.
